            <head>Biographical Note</head>

            <p>Education reformer Deborah Meier (1931-) is frequently credited with founding the modern small schools movement in the United
                States. Meier was born on April 6, 1931 in New York City to Pearl Larner Willen and Joseph Willen. She had one brother, Paul
                Willen, born in 1928. Meier's father served as the vice-president of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and her mother
                held positions in numerous organizations during her lifetime, including that of president of the National Council of Jewish
                Women. Deborah Meier grew up in New York City, where she attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School. She began attending
                Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio during the fall of 1949, but left before completing her degree to enter the
                University of Chicago in 1952, where she earned a master's degree in American History in 1955. She married Frederick Julius
                Meier on March 21, 1952, with whom she had three children. Beginning in the 1950s, Meier was also an active socialist,
                participating in the Young People's Socialist League and contributing articles to several socialist publications.</p>
            <p>Deborah Meier began her career in education in 1963 as a kindergarten teacher in Chicago. In 1966 she returned to New York
                City, where she taught at PS 144 and was involved in open-corridor class experiments. In 1974, the superintendent of New
                York City's school district 4 invited Meier to create an alternative elementary school in East Harlem, a school which became
                Central Park East. This school was so successful that it was expanded into three schools: Central Park East I, Central Park
                East II, and River East. In 1985 Meier and the Central Park East staff again expanded the school, this time adding Central
                Park East Secondary School for students in 7th through 12th grade. Deborah Meier's work at Central Park East brought her
                recognition in the form of a MacArthur fellowship, which she received in 1987. Meier was the first public school teacher to
                win this award.</p>
            <p>Meier began expanding her efforts in education reform as co-director of the Coalition Campus Schools Project, a position she
                held from 1992 to 1996. This project was an initiative to restructure large, failing high schools into multiple smaller
                schools. In addition, she was involved in New York City’s Annenberg Challenge and was a Senior Fellow at the Annenberg
                Institute at Brown University from 1995 to 1997. Meier was also involved in the Coalition of Essential Schools and the New
                York Network for School Renewal.</p>
            <p>In 1997, Meier left New York City to found Mission Hill, a pilot elementary school in Boston. She served as Mission Hill's
                principal until 2005.</p>
            <p>Meier has written numerous articles and several books on education, including <title render="italic">The power of their
                    ideas: Lessons for America from a small school in Harlem</title> (1995), <title render="italic">Will standards save
                    public education?</title> (2000), and <title render="italic">In schools we trust: Creating communities of learning in an
                    era of testing and standardization</title> (2002). She also wrote <title render="italic">Keeping school: Letters to
                    families from principals of two small schools</title> (2004) with Ted and Nancy Sizer and edited <title render="italic">Many children left behind: How the No Child Left Behind Act is damaging our children and our schools</title> (2004)
                with George Wood. Meier has received much recognition for her work, including honorary degrees from Harvard, Yale, Brown,
                and many other universities.</p>
