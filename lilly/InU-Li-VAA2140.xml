         <p>Consists of the papers of Bob Shanks and Ann Zane (Kushner) Shanks. The
				correspondence is both personal and business-related and may be found throughout the
				collection. Proposals for television programs, television and film scripts,
				articles, book drafts, and other materials related to projects written, produced, or
				created by the Shankses have all been combined under the Works series. The Personal
				series not only contains items related to Ann and Bob such as date books, academic
				and political materials, but also those concerning family members including Bob's
				brother Billy Glenn Shanks, his father Wilbur Glenn Shanks dating from 1928, and
				other relatives. Also present in this series is correspondence with their three
				children: Jennifer (Shanks) Kingsley, Anthony and John, including materials
				associated with John's career as a musician and music producer. There is an
				extensive file of <title render="italic" >Playbill</title>, 1982-2005, and many more
				programs from concerts and plays attended by the Shankses. Eighteen
				scrapbooks of mostly press clippings documenting the Shankses careers and personal
				lives complete the collection. Additions include materials received after the initial gift in 2005.</p>
