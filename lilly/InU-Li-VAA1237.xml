         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Bogdanovich was born in 1939 in Kingston, New York, the son of Serbian-Austrian Jewish
            immigrants who had fled Europe during the spread of Nazism. As a teenager he attended
            Stella Adler's Theatre Studio, going on to mount a successful Off-Broadway production of
            Clifford Odets' <title render="italic">The Big Knife</title> at the age of twenty. In
            1964 Bogdanovich moved to California and turned his attention to filmmaking, starting as
            a second-unit director, location scout and editor for Roger Corman. Bogdanovich directed
            his first motion picture, the cult thriller <title render="italic">Targets</title>,
            starring Boris Karloff, in 1968.</p>
         <p>His breakthrough film came three years later: <title render="italic">The Last Picture
               Show</title> (1971). Based on the novel by Larry McMurtry, the movie was a box-office
            hit and nominated for eight Academy Awards, winning two. A string of commercially
            successful and critically acclaimed films followed: the screwball farce <title
               render="italic">What's Up Doc?</title>, starring Barbra Streisand and Ryan O’Neal
            (1972); the Depression Era comedy- drama <title render="italic">Paper Moon</title>
            (1973), which won ten-year-old Tatum O’Neal an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress; and
            the seminal documentary <title render="italic">Directed by John Ford</title> (original
            release in 1971, rereleased with new footage in 2006). Other films directed by
            Bogdanovich include <title render="italic">Daisy Miller</title> (1974), <title
               render="italic">At Long Last Love</title> (1975), <title render="italic"
               >Nickelodeon</title> (1976), <title render="italic">Saint Jack</title> (1979), <title
               render="italic">They All Laughed</title> (1981), <title render="italic">Mask</title>
            (1985), <title render="italic">Texasville</title> (1990), <title render="italic">Noises
               Off</title> (1992), <title render="italic">The Thing Called Love</title> (1993), and
               <title render="italic">The Cat’s Meow</title> (2001). He is credited for writing or
            co-writing the screenplays for <title render="italic">The Last Picture Show</title>, its
            sequel <title render="italic">Texasville</title>, and many other movies.</p>
         <p>Additionally, Bogdanovich has acted in several films and television series, most notably
            fifteen episodes of HBO's <title render="italic">The Sopranos</title>, and is a
            distinguished film scholar. His early-1960s monographs on Orson Welles, Alfred
            Hitchcock, and Howard Hawks were influential contributions toward the development of the
               <emph render="doublequote">auteur theory.</emph> He has written film criticism for
               <title render="italic">Esquire</title>, <title render="italic">The New York
               Times</title>, and <title render="italic">Cahiers du Cinema</title>, as well as
            numerous books on American film, including <title render="italic">John Ford</title>,
               <title render="italic">The Cinema of Alfred Hitchcock</title>, and <title
               render="italic">This is Orson Welles</title>. He also wrote <title render="italic"
               >The Killing of the Unicorn: Dorothy Stratten (1960-1980)</title> based on his
            relationship with the Playboy centerfold who was murdered by her estranged husband.
            Bogdanovich is the owner/founder of several production companies, including Saticoy
            Productions, Inc., Copa de Oro Productions and Moon Pictures.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
         <p>The Bogdanovich mss., 1885-1994, consist of the papers, scripts, correspondence,
            business records, production materials, and films of director, actor, screenwriter,
            producer, critic and author Peter Bogdanovich. The Office series consist largely of
            correspondence relating to both Bogdanovich’s business and personal affairs. The Films
            series also includes correspondence, along with scripts, production materials, stills,
            artwork, press kits, posters and clippings pertaining to Bogdanovich’s body of work. Of
            particular note in this series are materials for the film <title render="italic">They
               All Laughed</title>, including box office statements, exhibitor contracts, and
            distribution records. Writings feature drafts and tear sheets of his articles and books,
            as well as some related correspondence.</p>
         <p>Another series contains the personal papers of Peter Bogdanovich's parents, Borislav and
            Herma Bogdanovich, who immigrated to the United States from Yugoslavia shortly before
            World War II, settling first in New York and later in Arizona. Boris, 1899-1970, was an
            artist by profession, and many papers relate to his exhibitions and the selling of his
            paintings. Much of their correspondence is with friends and family remaining in
            Yugoslavia. Also featured in this section are Peter’s letters to his family and papers
            relating to his childhood and his early education at Collegiate School in New York.</p>
         <p>The final series, <emph render="doublequote">Mixed Media,</emph> contains 16mm, 35mm and
            videotapes of some of Bogdanovich's movies, including most of the complete footage for
               <title render="italic">They All Laughed</title> and hundreds of outtakes and trims
            from the film. Other unique items in this series are <emph render="doublequote">gag
               reels</emph> and <emph render="doublequote">behind-the-scenes</emph> promotionals
            from <title render="italic">What’s Up Doc?</title>, <title render="italic">At Long Last
               Love</title>, <title render="italic">Nickelodeon</title>, <title render="italic"
               >Saint Jack</title>, <title render="italic">Paper Moon</title>, and <title
               render="italic">Daisy Miller</title>. Additionally, there are hundreds of audio
            cassettes of music used in his movies, along with reel-to-reel audiotapes of interviews
            conducted by Bogdanovich with (or about) prominent film directors. Also present are
            thousands of color slides, primarily publicity and production shots for several of his
            films. Of particular note are more than 300 color slides taken during the production of
               <title render="italic">The Last Picture Show</title>, which was filmed in black and
            white. <emph render="bold">Please contact Cherry Williams, Curator of Manuscripts, to
