                Mercer Dorson, 1916-1981, Indiana University professor and internationally renowned
                folklorist. The correspondence section, consisting of approximately 14,500 items
                arranged chronologically, documents Dorson's determination to turn the American
                Folklore Society and American folklore studies away from amateurism toward rigorous
                scholarship. The correspondence also shows Dorson's wide network of national and
                international relationships established with numerous scholars over the years.
                Writings in the collection are divided into those by Dorson and those by other
                folklorists, historians, and colleagues. Fieldwork and research materials in the
                collection include notes, transcriptions, and field tapes. Dorson's Indiana
                University related files include materials for the Folklore Institute, the Folklore
                Archives, the Archives of Traditional Music, the History Department, and various
                university committees. Also here are papers of folklore and history students,
                dissertation materials, and Dorson's class notes. </abstract>

                first Chairman of the Folklore Department. Dorson also held a variety of visiting
                professorships, including a year at the University of Tokyo as a Fulbright Visiting
                Professor in American Studies (1956), a semester at the University of California,
                Berkeley (1968), and a semester at the University of Pennsylvania (1980). </p>
            <p>A tireless scholar and researcher, Dorson received many awards and honors over the
                years, beginning with the Harvard Sheldon Traveling Fellowship for 1942-1943. Other

                fellow at the National Humanities Center's Research Triangle Park in North Carolina,
                1978-1979. His many grants from a variety of foundations and institutions include
                the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Smithsonian Institution, and the U.S.

                Society's delegate to the American Council of Learned Societies, 1969-1973. Dorson

                and field tapes. Dorson's Indiana University related files include materials for the
                Folklore Institute, the Folklore Archives, the Archives of Traditional Music, the
                History Department, and various university committees. Also here are papers of
                folklore and history students, dissertation materials, and Dorson's class notes. </p>
            <p>This collection of his papers contains the following categories of material:
                correspondence, writings, research and fieldwork, University materials, and
                miscellaneous personal and professional files. </p>
            <p> The correspondence section, consisting of approximately 14,500 items arranged
                chronologically, documents Dorson's determination to turn the American Folklore
                Society and American folklore studies away from amateurism toward rigorous
                scholarship. He set standards for folklore scholarship on all levels--research,
                documentation, writing, and the material to be studied. The correspondence also
                shows Dorson's wide network of national and international contacts, including
                personal relationships established with numerous scholars over the years. </p>
            <p>Writings in the collection are divided into those by Dorson and those by other
                folklorists, historians, and colleagues. Materials for the following books by Dorson

            <p> He edited and wrote the foreword to all volumes of the Folktales of the World
                Series, and both drafts and/or final manuscript copy of many of these volumes are in
                the collection. </p>
            <p> The type of material present for Dorson's publications varies but most often
                includes research materials, drafts of manuscripts, galleys and page proofs,
                corrected proofs, book production materials, publicity and reviews. There are also
                materials for about ten more books which he was considering publishing. </p>
            <p> Dorson also wrote approximately 200 articles, most of which are represented in the
                collection in various phases of development from notes to final printed item. He
                prepared numerous reviews of printed works and frequently provided critical
                evaluations of items that had been submitted for publication, and many of these are
                present or are represented in these files. Papers and/or notes for papers presented
                at conference and seminars, as well as materials relating to several journals
                (especially the <emph render="italic">Journal of the Folklore Institute</emph>), and
                series (particularly the Indiana University Folklore Institute Monographs Series),
                which he edited are also here. </p>
            <p> Fieldwork and research materials in the collection include notes, transcriptions,
                and field tapes from Dorson's work in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the 1940's;
                in Calvin, Michigan and Pine Bluff, Arkansas in the early 1950's; in Jonesport,
                Maine, 1956; and in northern Indiana, 1968 and mid 1970's. These files highlight
                areas of special interest to Dorson--early American heroes; Black, immigrant,
                occupational (lumberjacks, cowboys, miners, railwaymen, steelworkers), and urban
                lore; as well as lore of the youth and counter cultures of the 1960's. </p>
            <p>Dorson's Indiana University related files include materials for the Folklore
                Department, the Folklore Institute, the Folklore Archives, the Archives of
                Traditional Music, the History Department, and various University committees. Also
                here are papers of folklore and history students, dissertation materials, and
                Dorson's class notes. </p>
            <p>The remaining files in the collection are a miscellany of materials pertinent to
                Dorson's career, including his testimony in 1970 Senate hearings for an American
                Folklife Bill. The many societies and councils of which Dorson was a member and the
                many conferences which he attended are also represented. Dorson's personal files, in
                addition to regularly updated vitae, include materials on grants and fellowships.
                Other files contain materials on a film about the Northeast Sea Community,
                photographs, and printed items. Amongst the last are journals, newsletters, and
                clippings on Dorson, on the Folklore Institute and Department, and on folklore in
                general. </p>
