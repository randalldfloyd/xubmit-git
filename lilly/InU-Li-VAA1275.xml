            Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1784, and presumably for the two other sons and daughter as
            well. Jane Johnson was the wife of the Rev. Woolsey Johnson, 1696?-1756, who built
            Witham Hall in 1752, and the daughter of Richard Russell who acquired Packwood Manor in
            1715 (subsequently heired by Jane to her sister Lucy) which was eventually sold to Sir
            Horace Mann.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
         <p>The Johnson, J. mss. consists of materials devised by Jane (Russell) Johnson primarily
            for the instruction of her son, George William Johnson. The materials consist of 438
            items and are arranged in 24 groups. Included are alphabet cards, religious and secular
            lesson cards, all hand-made. Some contain colored illustrations and are decorated with
            multi-colored Dutch paper. </p>
         <p>The materials, arranged in 24 groups, consist of 438 pieces. Present are six sets of
            alphabet cards, many with vowel sounds, syllables, words and short lines or verses
            (which could serve as modern flash cards); three sets of word cards, also with vowel
            sounds, syllables and lines; two booklets; three sets of lesson cards in verse and
            anecdotal form on religious and secular topics; five card sets, largely secular and
            contemporary in nature with some traditional story-verses; and three card sets of
            religious and moral instruction, along with a set of word chips.</p>
         <p>The largest group of materials is that of set no. 7 which includes the 78 word chips
            denoting chiefly food products such as Ale, Almonds, Bacon, ... , Veal, Water,
            Wild-fowl, housed in a small paper box decorated with playing card symbols cut from a
            Dutch-made paper.</p>
         <p>References to contemporary personages and secular topics include George Berkeley, bishop
            of Cloyne, who advocated the curative powers of tarwater (no. 14 - Doctor Berkeley and
            Enoch Martyr cards); John Thomas, Bishop of London (no. 14 - Master Isaac Seabright);
            George Wright, member of Parliament (no. 14 - Two tame swans); the French dances,
            ridotto (no. 19 - Lord Mountjoy) and rigadoon (no. 19 - Miss Carpenter); anti-French
            bias (no. 17 - Hark the drums and no. 21 - Such short gowns); an acrobat (no. 21 - This
            Girl to get money); a woman's independence (no. 21 - Pray Madam come this way);
            toothache (no. 18 - A Boy and a Girl).</p>
         <p>The stories, briefly noted, include those of the faithful dog betrayed (no. 14 - A
            farmer came home); A Fable (no. 15 - The Old man and Death: he calls upon Death but when
            he appears, asks for help with his load); The Eagle and the Child (no. 15 - As a hungry
            eagle: it seizes the child from the cradle); and a nonsense rhyme (no. 18 - If all the
            world was [sic] paper).</p>
         <p>Sets 22 and 23 contain many identical religious and moral statements, including five of
            the Ten Commandments.</p>
         <p>Factors for dating the material are derived from a figure on a card which bears a
            printed identity (set 1, item 36: Sir John Bernard, alderman and Lord Mayor of London,
            1738); one of the booklets (no. 11 - George William Johnson, his Book, Printed and Bound
            by his Mamma [Jane Johnson] 1745); and a card (no. 14 - Simon Lord Lovat) which notes
            that Lord Lovat was beheaded on April 9, 1747.</p>
         <p>The materials are sturdily constructed of two or more pieces of paper pasted together,
            some of which bear partial watermarks, with the wording hand-printed on grooved lines in
            black and red ink. Bordered or decorated in brown, orange, and green multi-colored paper
            of Dutch origin, the cards frequently are illustrated by figures (plain or hand-colored)
            of people, birds, animals, and objects cut from printed sources. One of the
            illustrations retains its printed source (set 21, item 15: Sold by John Bowles at the
            Black Horse in Cornhill). Many of the cards have small string or cord hangers.</p>

                     <p>It is dangerous Folly/ To jest with Things holy./ Keep your Books without
                        Blot,/ And your Cloaths without Spot./ Let your Hands do no wrong,/ Nor
                        Back-bite with your tongue./ Make Haste to obey,/ Nor dispute nor delay.</p>
