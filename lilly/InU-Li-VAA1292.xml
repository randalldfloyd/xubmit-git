				<head>Biographical Note</head>
				<p>Upton Sinclair was born in Baltimore, September 20, 1878, and grew up there and
					in New York City. He began his writing career as a teenager, producing
					pseudonymous boys' adventure stories for pulp magazine publishers, as well as
					writing jokes for humor magazines. Between 1900 and 1905 Sinclair published five
					novels, but it wasn't until <title render="italic">The Jungle,</title> published
					in 1906, that he became an internationally known author. The success of this
					novel, which deals with the appalling conditions in the meat packing plants in
					Chicago, not only made Sinclair a rich man but also provided the final impetus
					for passage of the pure food law of 1906. With the proceeds from the sale of the
					novel Sinclair set up a communal living experiment called Helicon Hall in New
					Jersey. A fire just one year later destroyed everything and left Sinclair and
					his young family impoverished once again.</p>
				<p>Following a tumultuous separation and divorce, Sinclair married Mary Craig
					Kimbrough and in 1914 they took up permanent residence in Southern California.
					From 1917 through the early 1940s Sinclair himself published virtually all of
					his books and pamphlets although many of the major works were published
					simultaneously by New York houses. Although one of America's best known
					Socialists, Sinclair succeeded in winning the Democratic party nomination for
					governor of California in 1934 and ran on his "EPIC" (End Poverty in California)
					platform. He lost the election but many of the ideas he expressed during the
					campaign affected advisors and officials in Roosevelt's administrations and
					later found expression in national legislation. In 1940 Sinclair published the
					first of the best-selling Lanny Budd series, volume three of which, <title
						render="italic">Dragon's Teeth,</title> won the Pulitzer prize for
					literature in 1943. The eleven volumes were wide-ranging historical novels
					presenting the political history of the Western World from 1913-1950, and they
					were immensely popular. After the death of his third wife in December 1967,
					Sinclair moved to a nursing home in New Jersey to be near his son, David, and
					family. He died peacefully, November 25, 1968.</p>
