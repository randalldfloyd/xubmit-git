         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Desmond Christopher Shawe-Taylor, 1907-1995, English music critic, was born in Dublin,
            Ireland and educated at Oxford. Upon graduation he was employed by The Royal
            Geographical Society as assistant editor of "Geographical Journal." After a short stint
            there he began writing mostly literary criticism and occasional music-related articles
            for <title render="italic">The Times,</title>
            <title render="italic">The Spectator</title> and other periodicals. In 1939 he joined
            the Royal Artillery of the British Territorial Army and served his final two years,
            1944-1945, as Captain in GIII Intelligence. He resumed his writing career after the war,
            this time with an emphasis on music. In 1945 he was retained as the music critic for the
               <title render="italic">New Statesman</title> and <title render="italic"
               >Nation,</title> and then gramophone critic for <title render="italic">The
               Observer,</title> as well as writing occasional articles for other journals. From
            1958 until his retirement in 1983 he was chief music critic of the <title
               render="italic">Sunday Times.</title> In addition, he made frequent broadcasts on BBC
            Home Service and Third Programmes about music, particularly opera, singing and
            gramophone records. Shawe-Taylor also has several books to his credit. He wrote <title
               render="italic">Covent Garden</title> (London: Max Parrish, 1948) and collaborated on
               <title render="italic">The Record Guide</title> (London: Collins, 1951) and <title
               render="italic">The Record Year</title> (London: Collins, [1953]) with Edward
