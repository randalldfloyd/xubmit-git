            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Robert Graves was an English poet, scholar, and novelist. In 1918, he married Nancy
                Nicholson with whom he eventually had four children, including Catherine Dalton.
                Nancy's progressive views on feminism, religion, and social issues, meant that their
                marriage and the children's upbringing were unconventional. Graves suffered from
                acute neurasthenia for most of Catherine's early years, the result of his
                experiences in the First World War, and this, combined with a lack of regular income
                from either Graves's writing or Nancy's painting, made for a tense family life.</p>
            <p>In 1926 the American poet Laura Riding was invited to join their household in Oxford
                and Cairo, where Graves was lecturing at the University. Riding and Graves
                collaborated on a number of projects, including the seminal <emph render="italic"
                    >Survey of Modernist Poetry</emph> in 1926, but Graves's marriage did not
                survive. Graves left to live in Spain with Riding.</p>
            <p>During World War II, Catherine married Clifford Dalton, a distinguished New Zealand
                scientist. He died in 1961 of cancer after the war when the couple was living in
                Australia. Catherine believed her husband had been the victim of physical and mental
                intimidation by unknown sources which related to both his work with the Australian
                Atomic Energy Commission, for which he was Engineer in Chief, and to his views on
                the use of nuclear energy. She wrote and published a book giving her account of
                Professor Dalton's career and the circumstances of his death, as well as what she saw as
                the persecution she and her children experienced at the hands of Australian
                government officials after his death. </p>
            <p>Graves supported his daughter with the writing of her
                book, both financially and through direct intervention, including a written appeal
                to the Queen, a holograph draft of which is included in the current collection, and
                through correcting her drafts. Catherine remained close with her father and although
                her permanent home is in Australia, during Graves's later years she spent long
                periods of time with him in Deyá.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>Graves's letters are both intimate and humorous and cover a wide range of topics
                including family life, friends, Graves's writing, the work and death of Catherine's
                husband, and politics. Some of the letters have appended notes from Robert's second
                wife, Beryl and there are a couple of letters from Beryl alone to Catherine. Also
                present in the correspondence files are a few letters from Robert to Catherine's
                children and their spouses; one to Clifford Dalton just before his death; one to
                Robert's sister Rosaleen; two drafts and a final typed copy of one to Her Majesty,
                Queen Elizabeth II; one to the Spanish Minister of Tourism, Manuel Fraga; a letter
                to Robert and a draft of one from him to Idries Shah; and a draft to the official
                organizer of the Pushkin celebrations in Moscow, declining an invitation to
                attend.</p>
            <p>In addition to the letters there are several holograph notes and fragments made by
                Catherine Dalton, annotated drafts of two poems by Robert Graves, and a folder of
                newspaper clippings and miscellaneous printed items.</p>
