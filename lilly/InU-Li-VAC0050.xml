            <p>Hugo Sonnenschein (1889–1953) published his first book of poetry in 1907 as a student
                in Vienna, and served as editor of the Czech Academic Club's almanac. After
                completing his military service in 1911, he wandered through Europe as a vagabond
                poet, continuing to write and publish while living in Paris, London and Berlin.
                During World War I he served on the Balkan front and was taken into custody several
                times for pacifist activities. After the war he turned to politics and helped found
                the Red Guard. In Prague he edited a communist weekly, and founded the
                Genossenschaftsverlag (Cooperative Publishing House) with Franz Werfel, Albert
                Ehrenstein and Alfred Adler. <title render="italic">Die Legende vom weltverkommenen
                    Sonka</title> appeared in 1920 and is still considered his major work. Although
                he was a co–founder of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, he was expelled from
                the Party in 1927 for protesting against the persecution of Leo Trotzki. In 1939, as
                German troops entered Czechoslovakia, he was arrested by the secret police, and in
                1943 deported to Auschwitz, along with his wife Rose, who was killed there. He was
                freed from the camp by the Red Army in 1945, taken to Moscow, and then returned to
                Prague, where he was imprisoned again and sentenced to twenty years on a charge of
                having collaborated with the State Police during the Second World War. He died on
                July 20th, 1953, while still in prison.</p>
