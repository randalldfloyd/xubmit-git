         <p> Geneticist and Nobel prize laureate. Muller was born and schooled in New York City,
            receiving an A.B., M.A. and in 1915 his Ph.D. from Columbia University. His first
            faculty appointment was at Rice University in Houston, Texas. He then accepted a
            two-year appointment as instructor at Columbia hoping it would lead to a permanent
            position. In 1920, however, Muller accepted an offer from the University of Texas. In
            Austin his experiments on fruit flies (<emph render="italic">Drosophila</emph>) first
            showed that exposure to radiation caused mutation in living organisms. This work would
            earn Muller the 1946 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.</p>
         <p>Muller applied for and won a Guggenheim fellowship in 1932 and left the U.S. in
            September to spend a year at the only <emph render="italic">Drosophila </emph>laboratory
            in Europe which was doing parallel work, Berlin's Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain
            Research. As the Nazi take over of the German government, the persecution of Jews, and
            the burning of forbidden books increased through 1933, Muller accepted a position at the
            Institute of Genetics in Leningrad. He had been elected a corresponding member of the
            Soviet Academy of Sciences, under whose auspices and budget basic research was carried
            out in the USSR, and in Leningrad for the first time he had an appointment as a
            full-time research scientist without teaching responsibilities. In December, 1934, he
            and his research group moved to Moscow. By 1936 Stalin was beginning his reign of terror
            with hundreds of arrests and executions, including prominent scientists who were falsely
            accused of Trotskyism. Stalin began influencing the outcome of scientific research and
            bitter disagreements with Trofim D. Lysenko, whose theories on genetics reflected party
            line politics, pushed Muller to enlist in the Spanish Republican cause as the best way
            of getting out of the Soviet Union. Although he worked for just eight weeks in Madrid
            during the spring of 1937, his service provided the immunity he needed for a permanent
            departure from the USSR in good standing and with the least damage to the reputations of
            his Russian colleagues.</p>
         <p>After leaving the Soviet Union in September 1937, Muller spent some weeks in Paris at
            Boris Ephrussi's laboratory before accepting an offer from F.A.E. Crew at the Institute
            of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh. Originally a temporary appointment, Muller was soon
            awarded a three-year Macauley Research Fellowship as well as some supplemental
            Rockefeller Foundation support to run his laboratory. It was during this period that he
            met a young German refugee named Dorothea Kantorowicz who had been appointed as a
            technician in the Institute's pregnancy laboratory. They were married in May 1939. The
            outbreak of war later that year greatly affected the working habits of the institute,
            and Crew initiated a determined effort to get Muller and his research placed in an
            American university. Despite failing to obtain any position offers the Mullers left for
            New York , via Lisbon, in September 1940. A month later Harold Plough offered Muller a
            temporary position at Amherst College in Massachusetts, an undergraduate liberal-arts
            college. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor Plough left Amherst for full-time service
            as bacteriologist with the U.S. Army and Muller was then given an indefinite appointment
            as a professor of biology; however that appointment was ultimately determined to end in
            June 1945. Following a visit to Bloomington, Indiana, and interviews with zoology
            department faculty and President Herman B Wells, Muller was offered an appointment as
            research professor, meaning that he would do as much graduate teaching as he desired but
            would not be expected to do any undergraduate teaching. Muller remained at Indiana
            University until his retirement in 1964.</p>
         <p> A year after his arrival at Indiana Muller received the Nobel Prize. He received many
            more awards and tributes over the years, including the Bossom Award, the Kimber Genetics
            Award, and several honorary doctorates. His death in 1968 came just two months before he
            would have received Indiana's honorary degree voted him by the Faculty Council and
            approved by the Trustees the year before. Muller was active in numerous scientific
            organizations and was in contact both personally and professionally with the leading
            geneticists and biologists of the day. Some correspondents represented in the collection
            include: Edgar Altenburg, Charlotte Auerbach, Gert Bonnier, Herbert Brewer, Cyril Dean
            Darlington, Max Delbrück, Milislav Demerec, Theodosius Dobzhansky, Carl Gottfried

                  <p>Muller was a member and sometime chairman. In 1955 the National Academy of
                     Sciences established a committee with six subcommittees to study the biological
                     effects of atomic radiation. The subjects of the subcommittees were: genetic
                     effects, pathologic effects, meteorological aspects, effects on agriculture and
                     food supplies, disposal and dispersal of radioactive wastes, and oceanography
                     and fisheries. The papers include correspondence, draft and summary reports,
                     and related materials. In addition, there are other materials related to the
                     effects of atomic radiation, mostly printed. (See also: NCRP for more
                     publications). Known dates and places of Subcommittee meetings:</p>

                     <p>A number of panels were established by North American Aviation, Inc. to
                        recommend experiments for early lunar exploratory missions. It was called
                        LESA, Lunar Exploration Systems for Apollo. Muller was on the panel on Life

                  <p> Trofim Denisovich Lysenko, geneticist, was president of the Lenin All-Union
                     Academy of Agricultural Sciences. He discounted Mendelian theories of genetics
                     in favor of Communist party line theories, i.e., that genetic characteristics
                     could be altered by simply changing the environment. Debate in Russia became
                     impossible when Lysenko announced that this theory was officially endorsed by
                     the Central Committee. Muller denounced him as a charlatan and resigned from
                     the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.</p>
