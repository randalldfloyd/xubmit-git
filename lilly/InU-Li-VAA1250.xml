         <p>Consists of letters and papers of Charles Warren Fairbanks, 1852-1918, and his son,
                Warren Charles Fairbanks, 1878-1938, newspaper publisher. The Charles Warren
                Fairbanks material, which comprises the bulk of the collection, consists of
                correspondence with prominent political figures, businessmen, bankers, friends,
                relatives and constituents; manuscript and printed speeches of Fairbanks; law office
                papers; bills and receipts; miscellaneous papers; newspaper clippings; invitations;

                Building Company, 1907-1918. </p>
         <p>The Warren Charles Fairbanks papers, 1918-1938, relate to the settlement of the
                estate of his father, Charles Warren Fairbanks; the Indianapolis News; the Fairbanks
                Blue ridge farms in Piatt County, Illinois; and the Fairbanks Valley farms in Greene
                County, Illinois.</p>
         <p>The collection consists of both bound and unbound materials. Bound volumes of
                manuscript material include letterpress copybooks, July 13, 1874- May 10, 1918,
                inclusive; railroad case records, 1882-1890; campaign speeches, 1890-1892; seven
                volumes of typescripts of speeches of Charles Warren Fairbanks, entitled vols.
                I-II-III-IV-V, campaign of 1904, vol. VI, November 8, 1904-October 22, 1906, vol.
                VII, October 22, 1906-October 8, 1907; personal account books, 1874-1895, a
                household account book, December, 1906- February, 1907; a volume of copies of
                letters recommending Enoch G. Hogate for U.S. district judge for Indiana; a history
                of the Fairbanks building company, 1907-1918; and diaries, 1898, 1901, and 1911, of
                Robert Fairbanks, son of Charles Warren Fairbanks. </p>
         <p>Bound volumes of printed material consist of scrapbooks of newspaper clippings,
                1887-1910; invitations, 1898-1900; addresses of Charles Warren Fairbanks, June 18,
                1894-December 29, 1905; the Western collegian, Ohio Wesleyan student paper, October
                4, 1871-June 27, 1872; and a photograph album. </p>
         <p>The unbound material in the collection is arranged in chronological order except for
                the following groups, which have been removed from the chronological arrangement and
                filed separately; bills and receipts, 1864-1938; papers relating to postoffice
                appointments and other postoffice matters in Indiana during Fairbanks' term in the
                U.S. Senate; miscellaneous printed material; calling cards and rubber stamps;
                invitations; newspaper clippings; and printed speeches of Fairbanks. </p>
         <p>The postoffice papers are arranged alphabetically by names of postoffices or, in some
                cases where material is too general to be classified by postoffices, by names of
                counties. Under each postoffice or county, arrangement is chronological. Two types
                of cross references to the location of postoffice materials have been inserted in
                this postoffice file: 1) references to letters containing information on Indiana
                postoffices which have been left in the main chronological file because they also
                contain matter of interest on subjects other that postoffices: 2) references to
                letters in the postoffice file which deal with more than one postoffice. </p>
         <p>The first box in the collection contains biographical and genealogical material
                relating to Charles Warren Fairbanks and his family. </p>
         <p>Some of the material in the collection is filed in a folio folder. </p>
