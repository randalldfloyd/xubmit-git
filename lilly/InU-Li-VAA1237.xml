            <p>Bogdanovich was born in 1939 in Kingston, New York. He attended Stella Adler's
               Theatre Studio and has appeared on stage, screen and television. He was film critic
               for Esquire, The New York Times, Cahiers du Cinema among others, and has written
               numerous books on American cinema, most notably <title render="italic">The Cinema of
                  Alfred Hitchcock,</title>
               <title render="italic">John Ford,</title> and <title render="italic">This is Orson
                  Welles.</title> He also wrote <title render="italic">The Killing of the Unicorn:
                  Dorothy Stratten (1960-1980)</title> based on his relationship with the Playboy
               centerfold who was murdered by her estranged husband.</p>
            <p>He is the owner/founder of several production companies including: Saticoy
               Productions, Inc., Copa de Oro Productions and Moon Pictures. Bogdanovich directed
               his first feature film Targets, starring Boris Karloff in 1968. His breakthrough
               film, however, was <title render="italic">The Last Picture Show</title> (1971) based
               on the Larry McMurtry novel. Several successful and critically acclaimed films
               followed, notably his documentary <title render="italic">Directed by John
                  Ford</title> (1971) and the comedies, <title render="italic">What's Up
                  Doc?</title> (1972) and <title render="italic">Paper Moon</title> (1973).
               Subsequent films include <title render="italic">Daisy Miller</title> (1974), <title
                  render="italic">They All Laughed</title> (1981), <title render="italic"
                  >Mask</title> (1985), and <title render="italic">The Thing Call Love</title>
               (1993). He is also credited for the screenplays of <title render="italic">The Last
                  Picture Show,</title> its sequel Texasville, <title render="italic">What's Up
                  Doc?,</title> and many others.</p>

         <p>Consists of the papers, scripts, films, etc., of actor, author, critic, film producer
            and director Peter Bogdanovich. </p>
         <p>The Office files, largely correspondence, relate to both his business and personal
            affairs. Correspondence is also present in the Film section along with scripts,
            production materials, stills, artwork, press kits, posters and clippings. Bogdanovich
            personally financed the distribution of <title render="italic">They All Laughed</title>
            and there are many additional materials for this picture, including box office
            statements, exhibitor contracts, and distribution records. Drafts and tear sheets of his
            articles and books, plus some related correspondence make up the Writing section.</p>
         <p>Included in the collection are the personal papers of Bogdanovich's parents, Borislav
            and Herma Bogdanovich. They immigrated to the U.S. from Yugoslavia shortly before World
            War II, settling first in New York and later in Arizona. Much of the correspondence is
            with friends and family remaining in Yugoslavia. Boris, 1899-1970, was an artist by
            profession, and many of the papers relate to his exhibitions and the selling of his
            paintings. Also included in this section are Peter's letters to his family, and papers
            relating to his childhood and his early education at Collegiate School in New York.</p>
         <p>Completing the collection are: 16mm, 35mm and videotapes of some of Bogdanovich's films,
            including much of the film shot and hundreds of outtakes and trims for <title
               render="italic">They All Laughed;</title> hundreds of audio cassettes of music for
            use in his films; and reel-to-reel audiotapes of interviews conducted by Bogdanovich
            with, or about, prominent film directors. Also present are thousands of color slides,
            primarily publicity and production shots for several of his films. Most notable, are
            more than 300 color slides taken during the production of <title render="italic">The
               Last Picture Show</title> which was filmed in black and white.</p>
