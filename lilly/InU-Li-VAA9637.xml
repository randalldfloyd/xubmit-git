            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Galway Kinnell, born in 1927, was a poet and professor. Kinnell was born in
                Providence, Rhode Island, received his BA from Princeton University and his MA from
                the University of Rochester in New York. His teaching career began at Alfred
                University in New York where he taught English. Since then he has held
                professorships at universities literally throughout the world, from Columbia
                University to the University of Grenoble in France and from the University of Iran,
                Teheran to the University of Hawaii in Honolulu. He has been a visiting professor or
                poet at such distinguished universities and colleges as Sarah Lawrence, Queens
                College of CUNY, Brandeis University, Skidmore College and the University of
                California, Irvine. He was visiting writer at Macquarie University in Sydney,
                Australia and resident writer at Deya Institute, Mallorca, Spain. In addition to his
                teaching duties, Kinnell has traveled extensively giving poetry readings.</p>
            <p>Kinnell's poetry began appearing in poetry magazines and anthologies in 1953. In 1960
                his first volume of poetry, <title render="italic">What a Kingdom It Was</title>,
                was published. By 1980 ten books of his poetry had been published. Although most
                prolific as a poet, Kinnell's other published works include: a novel, <title
                    render="italic">Black Light</title>; a children's book, <title render="italic"
                    >How the Alligator Missed Breakfast</title>; illustrations for a book of poetry
                by Pati Hill; and translations of such writers as Yvan Goll, Rene Hardy, and
                Francois Villon.</p>
            <p>The quality of his work over the years has brought to Kinnell many awards and prizes,
                such as the Ingram Merrill Foundation award, an Amy Lowell traveling fellowship, the
                London Translation Prize, and the Shelley Prize from the Poetry Society of America.
                Not least among these is the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for his work <title
                    render="italic">Selected Poems</title>.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Kinnell mss., 1936-1980, consists of the correspondence, writings and other
                papers of poet and professor Galway Kinnell, 1927- . Among his papers are many
                drafts of the poems found in his volume <title render="italic">Selected
                    Poems</title>, for which he won the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. In general,
                the correspondence concerns Kinnell's teaching and poetry readings. Through the
                exchange of writings, advice and criticism was sought among peers, and this
                relationship with his colleagues is also reflected in the letters.</p>
            <p>The collection includes countless drafts and worksheets of his writings as well as
                page proofs, galleys, book production material and printed reviews of his published
                works. There is also a large section of writings by other poets and authors.</p>
            <p>Present also are writings from Kinnell's childhood years, as well as class notes,
                papers, and lecture material covering his academic career.</p>
            <p>The collection concludes with a miscellaneous section which contains, among other
                items, material concerning his activities with both the civil rights movement and
                anti-war protests of the 1960's and early 70's.</p>
