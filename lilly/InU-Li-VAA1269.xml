            <p>The Howdy Doody Show aired from 1947-1960. It was the first television network show
                to run five consecutive days a week, the first to broadcast in color, and it won the
                George Foster Peabody Award "for outstanding children's program during 1948." This
                was the first Peabody Award, originally for radio programming, that went to a
                television feature.</p>

            <p>Consists of correspondence, memoranda, contracts, and other documents relating to the
                television program The Howdy Doody Show. The materials are from the files of Martin
                Stone, owner and producer of the show. The correspondence and contracts date
                1946-1954 and are primarily with Robert E. Smith who was "Buffalo Bob" on the
                program. The 1969-1986 correspondence involves some effort to revive the show as
                well as discussions about licensing and ownership of the program and the music
                composed for it. Correspondents in these later files include Edward G. Kean, the
                composer of the program music. The original manuscript of Kean's "You don't cross
                the street with your feet" and a folder of clippings complete the collection. </p>
