            <p>The Thiébault Family mss. follows four generations of a Franco-British family living
                in 18th and 19th centuries. The first generation is represented in the papers of
                Dieudonné Thiébault (1733-1807). Dieudonné received a Jesuit education in Colmar,
                Dijon, and Épinal before continuing to study the liberal arts in Paris. After
                marrying Nicole–Louis de Sozzi (the daughter of eminent lawyer Louis de Sozzi) in
                December 1764, Dieudonné accepted a teaching position at Frederick the Great's École
                Militaire in Berlin. The Thiébault's remained at the court for the ensuing twenty
                years and Dieudonné became an intimate friend of the Emperor's. In 1785, the
                Thiébault's returned to Paris where Dieudonné was named Keeper of the Archives and
                Sous-Chef of the Bureau de la Librarie. Dieudonné was deprived of his office during
                the Revolution and returned to Épinal where he taught at the École Centrale.
                Dieudonné continued to write on literary, linguistic, and philosophic matters before
                dying in 1807. </p>
            <p>Paul Charles François Adrien Henri Dieudonné was born to Dieudonné and Nicole in
                1769. He received his education at the École Militaire and, after his family's
                return to Paris, joined a detachment of the national guard at the outbreak of the
                Revolution. He later joined the regular army and rose swiftly through the ranks,
                appointed Brigadier General in 1801 and Major General in 1808. Napoleon named Paul
                the Governor of Fulda in October 1806. Paul also governed Biscay and Old Castille at
                various times during this period. In these positions, he was the leading French
                military figure on the Iberian Peninsula from 1807 to 1811 and was placed in charge
                of the Portuguese campaign of 1807-1808. In 1811, Paul was ennobled and named a
                Baron de l'Empire, a title transferrable to male descendants. Although temporarily
                disgraced during Napoleon's Hundred Days for his indiscreet loyalty to the Emperor,
                Paul's good reputation persisted in the following decades as he — like his father
                before him — took up literary exploits and published several texts on military
                history and tactics. </p>
            <p>Paul's professional success balanced a tumultuous personal life. In 1793, he and his
                superior officer — Étienne de Jouy — met two British sisters who were residing with
                their mother and step-father in the French city of Lille. Both couples married
                within six months of their initial meetings; De Jouy wed Isabella Walker (1733-1830)
                while Paul married Elizabeth "Betzy" Walker (1767-1824). The Walkers were the
                daughters of James Walker and Lady Mary Hamilton (1739-1816), the latter of whom was
                an early feminist author best known for <title render="italic">Munster
                    Village</title>, a 1778 novel centered on a utopian community of women pursuing
                higher education. Lady Mary left Walker in the early 1790s to live with her lover,
                British merchant George Hamilton, in Lille. </p>
            <p>Paul and Betzy's love during this period is reflected in their early correspondence
                but their relationship was under constant strain from Paul's absences due to
                military obligations, Betzy's continual pregnancies (in ten years of marriage, the
                Thiébaults had three children and two others who died shortly after birth), and her
                British roots. Two of Betzy's siblings served in the British military — James
                (1764-1831) was a successful naval officer and eventually rose to Rear Admiral while
                David was a captain in the army. Suspicions regarding Betzy's loyalties resulted in
                her imprisonment for several months in 1794. Paul met another woman, Zozette, on
                Bastille Day 1802. He separated from Betzy in December of that year while she was in
                the later stages of pregnancy with their last child. Paul and Betzy's divorce was
                finalized in July 1804 and Paul married Zozette later that summer. The couple had
                several children, one of whom — Claire (1807-1894) — was the person responsible for
                the publication of Paul's memoirs. </p>
            <p>Paul and Betzy's marriage resulted in the the birth of three children who survived to
                adulthood: Adolphe (1797-ca.1875), Melanie Laure, and Alfred (b.1803). All are
                heavily represented in the manuscript collection but Adolphe is the central figure.
                Adolphe followed his father into the military and eventually became an instructor at
                various academies. However, his importance to the collection lies in his skills as a
                historian and his efforts to compile his family's archives. All the present
                collections except for the miscellaneous series were organized by Adolphe. </p>
            <p>Adolphe's own personal life was quite the opposite of his parents'. On a trip to
                visit his mother in London in 1818, Adolphe met Harriet Thayer (1791-1860), the
                daughter of a English country gentleman named Edward Loveden. Adolphe and Harriet
                courted over the ensuing years before marrying in November 1822. The Thiébaults had
                one daughter, Henrietta Malvina, who later married an English naval officer,
                Valentine Otway Inglefield. The Thiébault's marriage appears to have been happy
                based on the materials in the manuscripts collection. They traveled extensively
                throughout Europe with Adolphe maintaining sketchbooks and journals of their trips.
                Harriet died in 1860 and Adolphe spent the following years writing her biography.
                Adolphe continued to compile the papers of various family members throughout the
                remainder of his life including those of Dieudonné, Paul, Betzy, Harriet, and his
                cousin Emma de Jouy (1793-1872) — the daughter of Isabella Walker and Étienne de
                Jouy. </p>

            <p>The collection consists of six series. The first five are bound collections belonging
                to, in order, Paul Thiébault, Adolphe Thiébault, Harriet Thayer, Emma de Jouy, and
                unknown owners. The sixth series includes the collections which were originally
                bound by Adolphe but have since been disbound; although arranged by Adolphe, the
                papers were written by various members of the extended Thiébault clan. Each series
                contains a mix of various materials including personal papers, letters, journals,
                professional papers, ephemera, and sketches. </p>

                        <p>Folio collection of seven songs; one is credited to Paul Thiébault and
                            two are by Étienne de Jouy. An inscription on the title page is in
                            Paul's hand and dedicates the work "Pour ma tres chere Petite fille,
                            Malvina." Henrietta Malvina Thiébault was not born until 1822 so this
                            came far after the composition of the work.</p>

                            Mary Hamilton, Betzy Walker, and Harriet Thayer), and a great many
                            panels from Adolphe's trip to London ca. 1817-1818 that depict urban
                            life and population. Also included is a pencil sketch of Adolphe's first
                            encounter with Harriet at No. 36 Curzon Street, London.</p>

                        <p>A one volume description of the Adolphe and Harriet's 1856 tour of
                            Switzerland, following their extended stay in Munich. Unlike the other
                            travelogues, this volume has no illustrations apart from two maps

                            have been transfered to Malvina in January 1842 according to a

                            follow announce her wedding to Valentine Inglefield and the subsequent
