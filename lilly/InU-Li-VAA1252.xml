            <p>Professor of Russian. </p>
            <p>Donald Mark Fiene was born in Schenectady, N.Y. He studied at Cornell University,
                1947-1951, the University of Louisville (M.A., 1961), and Indiana University (Ph.D.,
                1974). He taught at the University of Louisville as a lecturer and instructor,
                1960-1972, and as a professor of Russian at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville
                from 1974 until his retirement in 1995. Among his other works he published <title

            <p>Consists mainly of correspondence between Professor Donald Mark Fiene, 1930- and
                author Kurt Vonnegut, 1922- regarding current activities in both of their lives and
                often discussing literary affairs. The letters from the 1970s concern Vonnegut's
                meeting with his Russian translator Rita Rait in Paris and his efforts on her behalf
                for honorary membership in the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in
                1979, together with photocopies of typed postcards signed by Arthur Miller and John
                Updike seconding her nomination. Other letters from Vonnegut offer advice to Fiene
                on his literary works, as well as comments on his own projects; discuss Fiene's
                family life; and relate their shared struggles with depression. The collection
                includes the originals of Vonnegut's letters to Fiene, and carbon or photocopies of
                Fiene's letters to Vonnegut.</p>
            <p> Also present in the collection are a photograph of Vonnegut and Rait taken in Paris
                Oct. 28, 1972, a bumper sticker with an undated note from Vonnegut, and the
                photocopy of a text, "First meeting," by Fiene that was published in <title
                    render="italic">Happy Birthday, Kurt Vonnnegut: a Festschrift for Kurt Vonnegut
