            <head>Biographical Note</head>

            <p>Better known by his pseudonym Anthony Boucher, White was born in Oakland, California,
                the only child of two physicians. He attended college in Southern California,
                graduating from the University of Southern California in 1932, then obtained an M.A.
                in German from the University of California at Berkeley. He initially planned to
                teach languages but turned to writing plays. Eventually he moved on to writing for
                newspapers, as theater and music critic for the Los Angeles based United Progressive
                News.</p>
            <p>After settling in Berkeley with his wife Phyllis, White successively—sometimes
                simultaneously—served as mystery book editor for the <emph render="italic">San
                    Francisco Chronicle,</emph> contributor and reviewer for <emph render="italic">Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine,</emph> creator, writer and announcer of
                "Golden Voices," radio KPFA, Berkeley, fantasy reviewer for the <emph render="italic">Chicago Sun-Times</emph> and <emph render="italic">New York
                    Herald Tribune</emph> (the latter under another pseudonym, H. H. Holmes),
                mystery reviewer for the <emph render="italic">New York Times Book Review,</emph>
                editor for <emph render="italic">True Crime Detective,</emph> and reviewer for <emph render="italic">Opera News.</emph> He won the Edgar Award three times for
                excellence in criticism. Additionally, White authored eight books of mystery or
                science fiction (two of them as H. H. Holmes), compiled <emph render="italic">The
                    Pocket Book of True Crime Stories</emph> (1941), and edited <emph render="italic">Great American Detective Stories</emph> (1945), <emph render="italic">Four and Twenty Bloodhounds</emph> (1950), the annual volumes of
                    <emph render="italic">The Best from Fantasy and Science Fiction</emph>
                (1952-1959), <emph render="italic">and Best Detective Stories of the Year</emph>
                (1963 and 1964).</p>

            <p>Perhaps White's most enduring contribution to science fiction and fantasy writing was
                the founding in 1949 of the <emph render="italic">Magazine of Fantasy and Science
                    Fiction</emph> with his friend J. Francis McComas. The two co-edited the
                magazine until McComas' resignation in 1954 to concentrate on his own writing. White
                resigned in 1958 after disagreements with the publishers, though he continued to
                write book reviews for the magazine. Other activities in White's career include:
                translator of detective and science fiction from French, Spanish, and Portuguese
                into English (he was an early translator of Jorge Louis Borge); writer of the
                Canadian Broadcasting Company's radio series' "Sherlock Holmes" and "Gregory Hood,"
                1945-1948; consultant for the television series "Checkmate"; and informal advisor
                and reference librarian to hundreds of writers, readers, and publishers in the
                fields of mystery and fantasy fiction. A most noteworthy posthumous recognition of
                his many contributions was the naming of the annual mystery fiction conventions as
                "Bouchercons" in 1969. </p>
